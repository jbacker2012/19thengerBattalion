                <p> The Vietnam war was a conflict between North and South Vietnam that lasted from 1955 to 1975. 
                    In March of 1965 U.S. troops were first deployed to help the South against the North. Roughly 
                    2,709,918 U.S. were deployed to Vietnam during this time(1965-1975). Eventually the U.S. withdrew 
                    the troops and the South lost to the North. While the war was going on there was a Battalion whose 
                    job it was to build ports, make airfields in the thick jungle landscape, make and repair bridges, sweep 
                    the fields for land mines and much more. One of those Battalions was my fathers, the 19th Engineers.

                <p> The 19th Engineer Battalion first deployed to Vietnam in 1965. My father was there from 1966 to 1967. 
                    Their mission was to upgrade highway QL-1 from a dirt trail to an all-weather road connecting Qui Nhon and Bong Son.
                    They also constructed the seven Bailey Bridges, decking three existing railroad bridges, and built six timber trestle bridges.
                    In the end, the 19th improved and upgraded more than 70 kilometers of QL-1, constructing 11 Bailey Bridges and 
                    34 timber pile bridges, all while having near daily enemy contact. On October 14, 1970 the unit returned back to the U.S having
                    suffered more than 505 casualties including 105 killed in action.

                <p> Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is one of many things that most soldiers brought home with them when they returned from the war. 
                    PTSD is also known as "Shell Shock". Most Veterans suffer from PTSD and majority 
                    never seek treatmant which can lead to depression, drug and alcohol abuse and suicide. 
                    Something most people don't realize is that PTSD doesn't affect just that person but also 
                    their friends and family. Growing up I thought having a fortified steel front door and door 
                    frame was normal. I also thought that doing a lock check before bed and watching anyone 
                    who parked in front of the house was all normal. It wasn't until I was an adult did I realize 
                    that my Father has PTSD and that it shaped me as an adult. Children whose parents are
                    suffering from PTSD symptoms show statistically significant increase in behavioral problems 
                    such as withdrawal, somatic complaints, thought problems, delinquent and aggressive behavior, 
                    anxiety/depression,attention deficit and problems in social relations. The Veterans Affairs (VA) 
                    provides therapy for veterans BUT they have to qualify for benefits which is a very stressful 
                    and difficult process.

                <h2> The Reunions </h2>

                <figcaption>The Veterans at one of the reunions.</figcaption>
                <p>Another way Veterans can find a way to cope with PTSD is reunions. When I was about 3 years old my half brother was in 
                    Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm which stressed my father out. He decided that he needed to find the men he served with, his "brothers". 
                    From there the 19th Engineer Battalion Annual Reunions was created. In 1991 my father went to a Vietnam Veterans reunion and there he 
                    met 5 other men whom he had served with. Together they started to make their own reunion just for their battalion. Present day there are 
                    roughly 300 members and on average about 50 of them attend the reunion every year. To me many of the vets and their wives are my Aunts and Uncles.
                    I never realized how important these reunions are until one year there was a Vet who had been looking for decades and finally found the men whom he served with. 
                    Later that same day that man was looking through some photo albums that the other vets brought when he stopped and started asking very loudly whose album that was. 
                    Apparently he had found a picture in there of his jeep that had been blown up due to a lund mine. He didn't remember anything from the incident.
                    The guy who brought the album was the very one who had rescued him. It was a very emotional moment for everyone.
